## Getting started

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Node] â€” at least 22, the latest LTS is recommended.
* [NPM] â€” at least 10, the latest LTS is recommended.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use [NVM] to install and use different versions of Node via the command-line.

```sh
# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-boilerplate.git my-new-project

# Enter the newly-cloned directory.
cd my-new-project
```

Then replace the original remote repository with your project's repository.

Then update the following files to suit your project:

* [`README.md`](README.md):
  The file you are currently reading.
* [`package.json`](package.json):
  * Package name: `@locomotivemtl/boilerplate`
  * Package title: `Locomotive Boilerplate`
* [`package-lock.json`](package-lock.json):
  * Package name: `@locomotivemtl/boilerplate`
* [`loconfig.json`](loconfig.json):
  * BrowserSync proxy URL: `locomotive-boilerplate.test`
    Remove `paths.url` to use BrowserSync's built-in server which uses `paths.dest`.
  * View path: `./views/boilerplate/template`
* [`environment.js`](assets/scripts/utils/environment.js):
  * Application name: `Boilerplate`
* [`site.webmanifest`](www/site.webmanifest):
